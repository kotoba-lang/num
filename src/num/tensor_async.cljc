(ns num.tensor-async
  "Closes the KNOWN GAP `num.tensor`'s own docstring documents (found live
  2026-07-13, ADR-2607131500): that namespace's host round-trips assume
  `num.array/->vec` resolves synchronously, which `num.deno-gpu`'s
  WgslBackendAsync — the only currently-live real-Metal device — does not
  (WebGPU buffer readback is inherently async). Confirmed live: calling
  `num.tensor/softmax` against the Deno GPU backend threw
  `[object Promise] is not ISeqable`.

  This does NOT generalize `num.tensor` to be async-aware (that would mean
  Promise-chaining its ENTIRE N-D broadcast/reduce/batched-matmul machinery
  — materially bigger scope). It closes the gap for EXACTLY the ops
  `comfyui.nodes.toy-diffusion`'s real node needs: 2-D transpose, 2-D last-
  axis softmax, single-channel conv2d, single-head attention — each a
  self-contained async host round-trip mirroring its `num.tensor` sync
  counterpart's exact math (so a discrepancy this uncovers is a genuine
  backend bug, not a reimplementation-drift bug), PLUS reuse of
  `num.core/matmul` UNCHANGED: `-gemm`/`-alloc` are fully synchronous even on
  `WgslBackendAsync` (only `-reduce`/`-dot`/`-nrm2`/`-copy-to-host` are
  async, per that namespace's own docstring) — so plain 2-D matmul already
  worked on the live GPU device with zero modification, verified by the
  14/14 in `num.deno-gpu-verify`.

  2026-07-13 (raise-the-maturity loop) adds `multi-head-attention-async`,
  closing the SAME gap for `num.tensor/multi-head-attention` — the real
  transformer/UNet attention block `comfyui.diffusion.model`'s
  `spatial-transformer`/`cross-attention`/CLIP's `self-attention` all need,
  now that `comfyui.diffusion.model`/`comfyui.clip.encoder` are `.cljc`.
  Unlike single-head `attention`, multi-head needs `num.tensor/matmul`'s
  BATCHED form, which is NOT async-safe (it does its own host round-trip) —
  see that function's own docstring for why it computes everything as one
  direct flat-index host round-trip instead of composing already-async
  primitives.

  CLJS-only (needs `navigator.gpu`/Deno, same as `num.deno-gpu`); the `:clj`
  branch is an informative stub, same convention as that namespace."

       the exact Promise-readback gap this ns exists to close, and there is no
