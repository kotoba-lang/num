(ns num.tensor
  "Phase 1 (ADR-2607051400 §Phase 1) — the N-D tensor layer on top of `num.array`
  and `num.core`.

  DESIGN CHOICE (documented per the task): this EXTENDS `num.array/NDArray`
  rather than introducing a new type. `NDArray` is already `{:backend :handle
  :shape}` where `shape` is an arbitrary-length vector and `num.array/nelems`
  is already `(reduce * 1 shape)` — that is, the existing record and every
  existing constructor/accessor (`from-vec`/`zeros`/`from-fn`/`->vec`) already
  work for rank-0 (scalar, `shape []`) through arbitrary rank with ZERO changes.
  What was actually missing was not a type but a set of SHAPE-AWARE OPERATIONS
  (broadcasting, reshape/transpose/squeeze/unsqueeze, axis reductions, batched
  matmul) that `num.core` never needed for its 1-D/2-D-only ops. So `num.core`
  is left untouched (its ops keep their existing fast, non-broadcasting,
  direct-to-`IBackend` dispatch — no behavior change, no regression risk) and
  every new N-D op lives here in `num.tensor`.

  HOST-MATERIALIZED, NOT DEVICE-NATIVE (documented tradeoff, matches the ADR's
  own phase split): `num.protocol/IBackend` has no notion of strides, gather,
  or scatter — a handle is an opaque flat contiguous buffer. Pushing
  reshape/transpose/broadcast/reduce/batched-matmul into `IBackend` itself
  (so a GPU backend could execute them without a host round-trip) is exactly
  what the ADR assigns to **Phase 2** (\"N-D matmul/broadcast dispatch is new
  WGSL\"). Phase 1's job is CORRECTNESS of the N-D semantics, held to the same
  \"real numbers, not just doesn't-throw\" bar as `num.cpu`'s reference loops —
  so every op here reads operands back to the host via `num.array/->vec`,
  computes with plain `double-array`/`aget`/`aset` loops (the same style
  `num.cpu` already uses, portable to `.cljc`), and re-uploads the result via
  `num.array/from-vec`. This works identically for ANY backend today (it only
  ever calls the existing `->vec`/`from-vec`/`-ewise` seam) and is the natural
  thing for Phase 2 to later short-circuit with direct-to-device kernels.

  `reshape`/`squeeze`/`unsqueeze` are the one exception: for a row-major
  contiguous layout, inserting/removing a size-1 axis or relabeling the shape
  without touching axis ORDER never moves data, so those three are pure
  metadata edits (`assoc :shape`) — zero-copy, zero host round-trip, on any
  backend.

  KNOWN GAP (found live 2026-07-13, ADR-2607131500 Phase 1): every op here
  that DOES round-trip assumes `num.array/->vec` returns an immediate value —
  true for `num.cpu`'s CpuBackend and `num.wgsl-backend`'s synchronous
  WgslBackend, but NOT true for `num.deno-gpu`'s WgslBackendAsync, whose
  `-copy-to-host` returns a JS Promise (WebGPU readback is inherently async —
  see that namespace's docstring). Calling any op below (including the
  `softmax`/`conv2d`/`attention` this phase adds) against a Deno GPU backend
  throws (`[object Promise] is not ISeqable`), confirmed by direct test.
  Most generic operations in this namespace still require that synchronous
  readback. Device-native exceptions now include metadata-only reshapes and the
  UNet path (SiLU, full NCHW convolution, GroupNorm, nearest upsampling, cat)
  through `ITensorBackend`; they are directly verified on Apple M4 Metal
  (`num.deno-gpu-verify`, 24/24).

  PARTIALLY CLOSED (same day): `num.tensor-async` (cljs-only) adds async
  twins of exactly `conv2d`/`attention`'s underlying ops (2-D transpose, 2-D
  last-axis softmax) — verified live on real Metal AND cross-checked against
  this namespace's own CPU-sync `attention` for the same inputs
  (`num.tensor-async-verify`, 4/4). `num.core/matmul` needed no async
  variant at all: `-gemm`/`-alloc` are fully synchronous even on
  WgslBackendAsync (only `-reduce`/`-dot`/`-nrm2`/`-copy-to-host` are async),
  confirmed by the pre-existing `num.deno-gpu-verify` 14/14. The general N-D
  layer here (broadcast-to/reduce-axes/batched matmul, and `sum`/`amax`/
  `amin`/`mean`) remains sync-only/CPU-verified-only — `num.tensor-async`
  deliberately targets only what `comfyui.nodes.toy-diffusion` needs, not a
  full async generalization of this namespace; see that ns's own docstring."
